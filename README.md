#Billy Trees

1. What I was able to do
   1. get an angular + .net project up and running despite not ever using .net and not using angular since before it was Angular2+
   2. Used the included bootstrap css to style a quick form.
   3. Added a quick bit of validation to at least require all the fields


2. What I was unable to do
   1. I could not get `PUT` or `POST` to work to the server.  From the googling I was able to do, it looks like I need to disable the `WebDAV` module, but I could not for the life of me figure out how to get it done.
   2. I need to get a response sent back as well with validation on the fields
   3. the `GET` endpoint to retrieve users was not implemented either.


## Setup Instructions
- Pull the repo down
- Use .net CLI and run `dotnet build`
- To run it locally run `dotnet run`
